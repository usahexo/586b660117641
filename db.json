many members are in the club","date":"2022-08-12T12:00:47.000Z","_content":"\n\n#  How many members are in the club?\n\nThe answer to this question is a little complicated. Depending on how you look at it, there are different answers. There are around 1000 members in the club, but this number can change depending on how you count people.\n\nIf you consider only dues-paying members, then there are only about 900 people in the club. However, if you include people who have attended meetings or events, then the number of people in the club swells to over 1000. This larger group includes friends of members and people who have simply been to one event.\n\nSo, the answer to the question depends on what criteria you use to determine membership. If you just look at the number of people who have paid dues, then the club has around 900 members. But if you include everyone who has ever attended an event or meeting, then there are over 1000 members.\n\n#  How did the club form?\n\nThe history of how the club came to be is a long and winding one. It all started back in 1892, when a group of workers from the Victorian Railways got together to form a football team. The club was originally called Essendon Railway Football Club, and they played their first official match in 1893.\n\nIn 1901, the club was renamed Essendon Football Club, and they joined the VFL (Victorian Football League).
