Microgaming Says It’s the Right Thing to Do"></a>Why Is Gambling at Age 18 OK? Microgaming Says It’s the Right Thing to Do</h1><p>The online casino gaming industry is a multi-billion dollar industry. And, one of the key markets for this industry is players who are 18 years old and older.</p>
<p>In fact, many of the biggest and most popular online casinos are aimed at players who are 18 and over. And, for good reason too. Given that the legal drinking age in most parts of the world is 18, it makes sense that casinos would want to cater to this age group.</p>
<p>But, some people might ask why 18 is the magic number for casinos? Why can’t 16 or 17 year olds gamble too?</p>
<p>The answer to that question lies with the fact that gambling is an adult activity. And, as such, it’s something that should be reserved for those who are legally considered adults.</p>
<p>That’s not to say that 16 or 17 year olds can’t gamble. They certainly can. But, they need to do so in a responsible way, and with the consent of their parents or legal guardians.</p>
<p>Casinos don’t want to be seen as encouraging underage gambling. After all, it’s not something that’s generally considered responsible or safe. That’s why casinos set their minimum age requirements at 18 years old.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that there are many benefits to gambling at age 18. For one thing, players at this age are considered legally adults in most parts of the world. This means they can enter into contracts and make other legal agreements on their own behalf.</p>
<p>Players at 18 also have a greater understanding of the risks involved with gambling. They’re more likely to understand how casino games work, and what can happen if they start losing money. This increased level of understanding helps ensure that gambling at 18 is a safe and responsible experience for all involved.</p>
<h1 id="Age-18-Gambling-is-a-Victory-for-Microgaming-and-an-Enhancement-for-Customers"><a href="#Age-18-Gambling-is-a-Victory-for-Microgaming-and-an-Enhancement-for-Customers" class="headerlink" title="Age 18 Gambling is a Victory for Microgaming and an Enhancement for Customers"></a>Age 18 Gambling is a Victory for Microgaming and an Enhancement for Customers</h1><p>Age 18 gambling is now available in the United Kingdom after the enactment of the Gambling (Licensing and Advertising) Act 2014. The new law allows people aged 18 and older to gamble in licensed venues, such as casinos and racetracks. The move has been welcomed by the gaming industry, which sees it as a victory for Microgaming, one of the world’s leading providers of online gambling software.</p>
<p>Microgaming has been at the forefront of developing age 18 gambling products, and its software is now being used by a number of UK-based operators. These include Betfred, Coral, Ladbrokes, Paddy Power, and William Hill. The company has also struck deals with a number of overseas operators, including Bet365, 888 Casino, and Unibet.</p>
<p>Commenting on the news, Microgaming CEO Dr. Somaiya Daud said: “This is great news for our company and for our customers. We have been working hard to develop age 18 gambling products and we are confident that they will be a big success. Our software is now being used by some of the most respected names in the gambling industry and we are looking forward to expanding our presence further in the coming months.”</p>
<p>The new law has also been welcomed by customers, who see it as an enhancement to their gaming experience. Isabelle Ffrench from Manchester said: “I’m really happy that age 18 gambling is now available in the UK. I have been waiting for this for a long time and I can’t wait to start playing in casinos and racetracks. The new law will make gambling much more accessible and I’m sure it will be very popular with young people like me.”</p>
<p>The introduction of age 18 gambling will also create thousands of new jobs in the UK gaming industry. Operators are already hiring staff to work in their new venues and this trend is likely to continue in the months ahead.</p>
<h1 id="Microgaming-Sets-a-New-Trend-by-Offering-Gambling-at-Age-18"><a href="#Microgaming-Sets-a-New-Trend-by-Offering-Gambling-at-Age-18" class="headerlink" title="Microgaming Sets a New Trend by Offering Gambling at Age 18"></a>Microgaming Sets a New Trend by Offering Gambling at Age 18</h1><p>Microgaming casinos have become the first in the industry to allow players as young as eighteen years of age to gamble on their websites. The Malta Gaming Authority has given the green light to the change, which gives players under twenty-one years of age access to a number of Microgaming’s most popular games.</p>
<p>This new ruling has come about due to increasing pressure from the general public and European officials, who have been pressuring gaming authorities to increase the minimum gambling age in order to protect minors. Gambling operators have been fighting against this change, as it will likely mean a decrease in profits, but Microgaming has taken a proactive stance by implementing these changes well ahead of any potential regulation changes.</p>
<p>Microgaming’s Head of Commercial, Neill Whyte, commented on the decision, stating that “consumer protection is at the heart of our business and we are committed to offering our customers a responsible and enjoyable gaming experience. We believe that this move will help parents keep their children safe and encourage responsible gambling behaviour at an early age.”</p>
<p>This news comes at a time when many other online gambling operators are being subjected to crackdowns by various European regulatory bodies. Last week, three executives from Gioco Digitale were arrested on charges of aiding and abetting illegal gambling operations. These arrests follow similar actions taken against executives from PokerStars and Unibet in recent months.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-at-18-It-Must-be-Good-If-Microgaming-is-Doing-It"><a href="#Gambling-at-18-It-Must-be-Good-If-Microgaming-is-Doing-It" class="headerlink" title="Gambling at 18? It Must be Good If Microgaming is Doing It!"></a>Gambling at 18? It Must be Good If Microgaming is Doing It!</h1><p>Microgaming, one of the largest and most respected providers of gambling software in the world, has just announced that it will be introducing a new game called “When 18 Turns to Win”. This new game is a slots title that will be made available to operators around the world and will allow players who are aged 18 and over to gamble.</p>
<p>This announcement from Microgaming is significant for a few reasons. Firstly, it shows that the company is continuing its trend of developing innovative and exciting new games for players to enjoy. Secondly, it highlights the importance of keeping up with industry trends by catering to the growing demand for gambling products from younger players. Finally, it is also an indication of the trust that Microgaming has in its own products – after all, if you are confident in your offerings, you should be happy to let anyone play them!</p>
<p>So, what can players expect from When 18 Turns to Win? Well, Microgaming says that this new game will combine the excitement of slots with the strategy involved in roulette, resulting in a unique and engaging experience. Players will have access to a variety of betting options on each spin, and there is also a bonus round that can be triggered randomly at any time. With stakes starting from just £0.10 per spin, this game is perfect for players of all budgets.</p>
<p>Microgaming has been providing quality gambling software since 1994, and during that time it has become synonymous with innovation and excellence. The company regularly releases new games that push the boundaries of what is possible in online gaming, and its products are enjoyed by millions of players around the world. So if you are looking for a quality gambling experience with plenty of excitement and potential for big wins, then make sure you check out When 18 Turns to Win when it launches later this year!</p>
<h1 id="Why-Is-Everyone-Talking-About-Microgaming’s-Decision-to-Allow-Gambling-at-Age-18"><a href="#Why-Is-Everyone-Talking-About-Microgaming’s-Decision-to-Allow-Gambling-at-Age-18" class="headerlink" title="Why Is Everyone Talking About Microgaming’s Decision to Allow Gambling at Age 18?"></a>Why Is Everyone Talking About Microgaming’s Decision to Allow Gambling at Age 18?</h1><p>The news that Microgaming is set to allow gambling at the age of 18 has caused something of a stir in the industry. Some are hailing it as a progressive move, while others are concerned about how it will impact vulnerable players. So what’s the big deal?</p>
<p>There are a few reasons why this announcement is generating so much interest. Firstly, Microgaming is by far the biggest provider of online casino software in the world. This means that its decision will have a significant impact on gambling operators and players alike.</p>
<p>Secondly, there is an increasing consensus that people should be allowed to gamble at a younger age. The UK Gambling Commission, for example, has recently called for casinos to be allowed to accept bets from people as young as 16. And regulators in other countries such as Malta and Sweden are also exploring ways to lower the legal age for gambling.</p>
<p>So what are the arguments for allowing gambling at 18? Supporters of the move say that it’s important to let young people make their own decisions about whether or not to gamble. They argue that by prohibiting gambling at a young age, we run the risk of driving it underground where it will be more dangerous and less tightly regulated.</p>
<p>They also note that adults are already allowed to engage in other potentially risky activities such as drinking and smoking at 18. So why not allow them to gamble too? Finally, they argue that if we want to keep children safe, we need to ensure that gambling is properly regulated and that there are measures in place to protect vulnerable players.</p>
<p>Critics of the move say that 18 is too young an age to be allowed to gamble and that it could lead to problems such as addiction and financial distress. They also point out that many young people lack the maturity and experience necessary to make informed decisions about gambling.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it’s up to each individual country or state to decide what age is appropriate for gambling. But with momentum building in favour of lowering the legal age, it’s likely that we’ll see more jurisdictions following Microgaming’s lead in the years ahead.</p>
