But what many people don’t know is how roulette actually pays out. In this article, we’re going to take a closer look at the secrets behind this popular casino game!</p>
<p>When you play roulette, you have the option to bet on a single number or a range of numbers. If your chosen number comes up, you win! So, how does roulette payout?</p>
<p>Well, when you make a bet on a single number, the odds are 35-1. This means that if you bet $10 on a single number and that number comes up, you will win $350! However, if you bet on a range of numbers (e.g. 1-18), the odds are lowered to 17-1. So, if you bet $10 on a range of numbers and that range comes up, you would win $170.</p>
<p>As you can see, roulette pays out pretty well! But it’s important to remember that there is always risk involved when playing casino games. So, make sure you always gamble responsibly!</p>
<h1 id="Are-You-Ready-to-Find-Out-How-Roulette-Pays"><a href="#Are-You-Ready-to-Find-Out-How-Roulette-Pays" class="headerlink" title="Are You Ready to Find Out How Roulette Pays?"></a>Are You Ready to Find Out How Roulette Pays?</h1><p>The roulette wheel has always been a fascinating game to many gamblers. There are those who swear that Roulette can be beaten and there are those who play the game simply for the excitement and fun it offers. Whichever category you may fit in, learning how Roulette pays is always an interesting topic to explore.</p>
<p>Before delving deep into the payouts of Roulette, let’s take a quick look at how to play the game. Basically, Roulette is played with a wheel that has 37 or 38 slots numbered from 0 to 36. A ball is spun around the wheel and when it stops, the player bets on which number it will end up in. The payout for each bet depends on the probability of that number coming up and is as follows:</p>
<p>-Straight up: A bet on any one particular number pays 35 to 1. So, if you bet $10 on a number and the ball lands on that number, you win $350 ($10 x 35).</p>
<p>-Split: A bet on two adjoining numbers on the betting grid pays 17 to 1. So, if you bet $10 on a split (two adjoining numbers), you would win $170 ($10 x 17).</p>
<p>-Street: A bet on three adjoining numbers on the betting grid pays 11 to 1. So, if you bet $10 on a street (three adjoining numbers), you would win $110 ($10 x 11).</p>
<p>-Corner: A bet on four adjoining numbers pays 8 to 1. So, if you bet $10 on a corner (four adjoining numbers), you would win $80 ($10 x 8).</p>
<p>-Six Line: A bet on six adjoining numbers pays 5 to 1. So, if you bet $10 on a six line (six adjoining numbers), you would win $50 ($10 x 5).</p>
<p>Now that we know how Roulette pays, let’s take a look at some of the probabilities associated with different types of bets. Obviously, some bets are riskier than others but they also offer higher potential payouts. Here’s a breakdown of some of the most common bets along with their associated probabilities:</p>
<p>-Straight up: A single number - Probability of winning is 2&#x2F;37 or 1&#x2F;19.2%. Payout is 35 to 1.</p>
<p>-Split: Two adjacent numbers - Probability of winning is 5&#x2F;37 or 13.5%. Payout is 17 to 1.</p>
<p>-Street: Three contiguous numbers - Probability of winning is 8&#x2F;37 or 21.6%. Payout is 11 to 1. </p>
<p>-Corner: Four contiguous numbers - Probability of winning is 10&#x2F;37 or 27%. Payout is 8 to 1. </p>
<p>-Six line: Six contiguous numbers - Probability of winning is 15&#x2F;37 or 40%. Payout is 5 to 1</p>
