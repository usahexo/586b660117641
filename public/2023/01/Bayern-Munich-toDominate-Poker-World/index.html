<p>Nitsche is currently ranked fifth on the all-time money list for live poker tournaments, with over $16 million in earnings. He has won three WSOP bracelets, as well as other major tournaments around the world.</p>
<p>In addition to Nitsche, other top Bayern players include Kempe and Vogelsang. Kempe is currently ranked eighth on the all-time money list, with over $14 million in earnings.
