This guide will show you how to do it with minimal supplies and tools.</p>
<p>You will need: </p>
<ul>
<li>A paper clip</li>
<li>A battery</li>
<li>Some tape</li>
</ul>
<p>Step 1: Straighten the paper clip out as best as you can.<br>Step 2: Tape the battery to one end of the paper clip.<br>Step 3: Tape the other end of the paper clip to your EMP port machine.<br>Step 4: Turn on your EMP port machine.<br>Step 5: Enjoy your newly functioning EMP port machine!</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Make-an-EMP-Portable-Machine-Jammer"><a href="#How-to-Make-an-EMP-Portable-Machine-Jammer" class="headerlink" title="How to Make an EMP Portable Machine Jammer"></a>How to Make an EMP Portable Machine Jammer</h1><p>Military grade EMP jammers are large, expensive and require setup. This guide will show you how to make a small, cheap and easy to use EMP jammer using commonly available parts.</p>
<p>The EMP portable machine jammer consists of two parts: the transmitter and the receiver. The transmitter is made up of an inverter, battery and antenna. The receiver is made up of a Schottky diode, resistor and indicator light.</p>
<p>The transmitter emits a high voltage pulse which creates an electromagnetic field. When this field hits the receiver, it causes a short circuit which in turn creates a current flow through the Schottky diode. This current flow lights up the indicator light on the receiver.</p>
<p>To build the transmitter, connect the inverter to the battery then attach the antenna to the inverter output. To build the receiver, connect the Schottky diode between the resistor and indicator light then attach the resistor to one end of the diode and indicator light to the other end.</p>
<p>When you’re done, it should look something like this: </p>
<p>  The transmitter can be powered by either a 9V battery or 12V battery while the receiver can be powered by either a 5V or 12V power supply.<br>To create an EMP portable machine jammer, simply connect the transmitter to the receiver using jumper cables. Then hold or attach it near to any device that you want to disable or “jam”.</p>
<h1 id="DIY-How-to-Make-Your-Own-EMP-Portable-Machine-Jammer"><a href="#DIY-How-to-Make-Your-Own-EMP-Portable-Machine-Jammer" class="headerlink" title="DIY: How to Make Your Own EMP Portable Machine Jammer"></a>DIY: How to Make Your Own EMP Portable Machine Jammer</h1><p>As we become increasingly reliant on electronic devices, the need for EMP protection becomes more important. An EMP portable machine jammer can help protect your devices from an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) event.</p>
<p>But what is an EMP? Electromagnetic pulses are brief but intense energy surges that can damage or destroy electronic equipment. They can be caused by natural phenomena such as solar flares, or man-made events such as nuclear explosions.</p>
<p>An EMP portable machine jammer is a device that emits a signal to disrupt or block electromagnetic pulses. This can help protect your electronic devices from being damaged or destroyed in the event of an EMP attack or surge.</p>
<p>There are a few different ways to make your own EMP portable machine jammer. The simplest way is to use a Faraday cage. A Faraday cage is a metal container that will shield electronic devices from electromagnetic pulses. You can make your own Faraday cage by wrapping a metal box with heavy duty aluminum foil. Be sure to tape all the seams and corners of the box to ensure there is no way for the pulse to enter.</p>
<p>Another option for making an EMP portable machine jammer is to use a microwave oven transformer. Microwave oven transformers contain capacitors, which are known to absorb and block electromagnetic pulses. To use a microwave oven transformer as a jammer, you need to remove the core and windings from the transformer and then reattach them so that they form a coil. The coil will then need to be connected to an audio amplifier circuit. When activated, this circuit will create a noise signal that will disrupt any electromagnetic pulses that try to enter the coil.</p>
<p>The final option for making an EMP portable machine jammer is to use a DIY Arduino shield kit. An Arduino shield kit is basically an electronic circuit board that can be attached to an Arduino microcontroller. There are many different types of Arduino shield kits available, each with its own specific capabilities. Some shield kits are specifically designed for blocking EM radiation, making them ideal for use as EMP portable machine jammers.</p>
<p>If you choose to make your own EMP portable machine jammer, it is important to test it regularly to ensure it is still working properly in the event of an actual emergency situation.</p>
<h1 id="Learn-How-to-Make-an-EMP-Portable-Machine-Jammer-from-Scratch"><a href="#Learn-How-to-Make-an-EMP-Portable-Machine-Jammer-from-Scratch" class="headerlink" title="Learn How to Make an EMP Portable Machine Jammer from Scratch"></a>Learn How to Make an EMP Portable Machine Jammer from Scratch</h1><p> EMP (electromagnetic pulse) is a type of disturbance that can propagate through space and time. An EMP portable machine jammer is a useful device that can help protect your electronic equipment from an EMP burst.</p>
<p>In this article, we will show you how to make an EMP portable machine jammer from scratch. The best part is that you don’t need any special skills or tools to do it!</p>
<ol>
<li>First, gather the supplies you will need. You will need:<br>-A metal box (small enough to fit in your pocket)<br>-A battery (9 volts or more)<br>-An amplifier circuit (you can find one online or build your own)<br>-Some wire<br>-Soldering iron<br>-Solder<br>-Some electrical tape<br>-A piece of metal (copper or aluminum work best)</li>
<li>Next, drill a hole in the metal box and mount the amplifier circuit inside. Make sure the amplifier circuit is facing out of the box so that it can broadcast the EMP signal. </li>
<li>Solder some wire to the amplifier circuit and run it out of the hole in the box. </li>
<li>Cut a piece of metal to fit over the hole in the box and use electrical tape to secure it in place. This will serve as your antenna for transmitting the EMP signal. </li>
<li>Connect the battery to the amplifier circuit and test it out!</li>

<h1 id="How-to-Convert-a-Regular-Device-into-an-EMP-Portable-Machine-Jammer"><a href="#How-to-Convert-a-Regular-Device-into-an-EMP-Portable-Machine-Jammer" class="headerlink" title="How to Convert a Regular Device into an EMP Portable Machine Jammer"></a>How to Convert a Regular Device into an EMP Portable Machine Jammer</h1><p>There are many reasons why someone might want to build an EMP Portable Machine Jammer. Perhaps they have a paranoid fear of being wiretapped and want to ensure their conversations remain private. Or maybe they work in a field where it is important to keep sensitive information confidential (like the military or law enforcement).</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, it is possible to convert a regular device into an EMP Portable Machine Jammer with just a few simple steps. The following guide will show you how to do it.</p>
<p>What You’ll Need:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Device You Want to Convert into a Jammer</li>
<li>An EMP Generator </li>
<li>Some Wires </li>
<li>Wire Cutters </li>
<li>Soldering Iron </li>
<li>Pliers </li>
<li>Tape </li>
<li>A Desired Frequency (optional)</li>
<li>A Calculator (optional)</li>
</ol>
<p>Step 1: Disable or Remove All Circuitry from the Device<br>The first step is to disable or remove all of the circuitry from the device you want to convert into a jammer. This can be done by cutting the wires or simply unscrewing them from the circuit board. Be very careful not to damage any of the components while doing this! If you’re not sure what you’re doing, it might be best to get help from someone who knows more about electronics than you do.</p>
<p>Step 2: Connect the EMP Generator to the Device<br>Once all of the circuitry has been removed, it’s time to connect the EMP Generator to the device. This can be done by using wires and soldering them onto the circuit board directly. Make sure that all of the connections are secure and won’t come loose when you’re using the jammer. If you don’t feel comfortable soldering, you can use tape instead; just make sure that there are no loose wires that could accidentally touch each other and create a short circuit.</p>
<p>  Step 3: Choose Your Frequency (optional) </p>
<p>Now that your jammer is assembled, it’s time to choose your frequency! This step is optional, but if you know which frequency you want to jam, it can be helpful to specifically tune your jammer for that wavelength. To do this, use a calculator (there are plenty of online calculators available) and enter in your desired frequency along with the electrical properties of your device (more information about this can be found online or in electronics textbooks). Once you have these numbers, enter them into your jammer and see how well it performs!</p>
