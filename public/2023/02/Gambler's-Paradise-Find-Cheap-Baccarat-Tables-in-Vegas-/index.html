And while most people think of blackjack and poker when they think of Vegas, baccarat is another great option if you’re looking to gamble on a budget.</p>
<p>In general, the baccarat tables in Vegas offer better odds and cheaper minimum bets than what you’ll find at most other casinos around the world. So if you’re looking for a high-stakes game with relatively low risk, baccarat is definitely worth checking out.</p>
