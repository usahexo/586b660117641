<li>A battery</li>
<li>Some tape</li>
</ul>
<p>Step 1: Straighten the paper clip out as best as you can.<br>Step 2: Tape the battery to one end of the paper clip.<br>Step 3: Tape the other end of the paper clip to your EMP port machine.<br>Step 4: Turn on your EMP port machine.<br>Step 5: Enjoy your newly functioning EMP port machine!</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Make-an-EMP-Portable-Machine-Jammer"><a href="#How-to-Make-an-EMP-Portable-Machine-Jammer" class="headerlink" title="How to Make an EMP Portable Machine Jammer"></a>How to Make an EMP Portable Machine Jammer</h1><p>Military grade EMP jammers are large, expensive and require setup. This guide will show you how to make a small, cheap and easy to use EMP jammer using commonly available parts.</p>
<p>The EMP portable machine jammer consists of two parts: the transmitter and the receiver. The transmitter is made up of an inverter, battery and antenna. The receiver is made up of a Schottky diode, resistor and indicator light.</p>
<p>The transmitter emits a high voltage pulse which creates an electromagnetic field. When this field hits the receiver, it causes a short circuit which in turn creates a current flow through the Schottky diode. This current flow lights up the indicator light on the receiver.</p>
<p>To build the transmitter, connect the inverter to the battery then attach the antenna to the inverter output. To build the receiver, connect the Schottky diode between the resistor and indicator light then attach the resistor to one end of the diode and indicator light to the other end.</p>
<p>When you’re done, it should look something like this: </p>
<p>  The transmitter can be powered by either a 9V battery or 12V battery while the receiver can be powered by either a 5V or 12V power supply.<br>To create an EMP portable machine jammer, simply connect the transmitter to the receiver using jumper cables. Then hold or attach it near to any device that you want to disable or “jam”.</p>
<h1 id="DIY-How-to-Make-Your-Own-EMP-Portable-Machine-Jammer"><a href="#DIY-How-to-Make-Your-Own-EMP-Portable-Machine-Jammer" class="headerlink" title="DIY: How to Make Your Own EMP Portable Machine Jammer"></a>DIY: How to Make Your Own EMP Portable Machine Jammer</h1><p>As we become increasingly reliant on electronic devices, the need for EMP protection becomes more important. An EMP portable machine jammer can help protect your devices from an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) event.</p>
<p>But what is an EMP? Electromagnetic pulses are brief but intense energy surges that can damage or destroy electronic equipment. They can be caused by natural phenomena such as solar flares, or man-made events such as nuclear explosions.</p>
<p>An EMP portable machine jammer is a device that emits a signal to disrupt or block electromagnetic pulses. This can help protect your electronic devices from being damaged or destroyed in the event of an EMP attack or surge.</p>
<p>There are a few different ways to make your own EMP portable machine jammer. The simplest way is to use a Faraday cage. A Faraday cage is a metal container that will shield electronic devices from electromagnetic pulses. You can make your own Faraday cage by wrapping a metal box with heavy duty aluminum foil. Be sure to tape all the seams and corners of the box to ensure there is no way for the pulse to enter.</p>
<p>Another option for making an EMP portable machine jammer is to use a microwave oven transformer. Microwave oven transformers contain capacitors, which are known to absorb and block electromagnetic pulses. To use a microwave oven transformer as a jammer, you need to remove the core and windings from the transformer and then reattach them so that they form a coil. The coil will then need to be connected to an audio amplifier circuit. When activated, this circuit will create a noise signal that will disrupt any electromagnetic pulses that try to enter the coil.</p>
<p>The final option for making an EMP portable machine jammer is to use a DIY Arduino shield kit. An Arduino shield kit is basically an electronic circuit board that can be attached to an Arduino microcontroller. There are many different types of Arduino shield kits available, each with its own specific capabilities. Some shield kits are specifically designed for blocking EM radiation, making them ideal for use as EMP portable machine jammers.</p>
<p>If you choose to make your own EMP portable machine jammer, it is important to test it regularly to ensure it is still working properly in the event of an actual emergency situation.</p>
<h1 id="Learn-How-to-Make-an-EMP-Portable-Machine-Jammer-from-Scratch"><a href="#Learn-How-to-Make-an-EMP-Portable-Machine-Jammer-from-Scratch" class="headerlink" title="Learn How to Make an EMP Portable Machine Jammer from Scratch"></a>Learn How to Make an EMP Portable Machine Jammer from Scratch</h1><p> EMP (electromagnetic pulse) is a type of disturbance that can propagate through space and time. An EMP portable machine jammer is a useful device that can help protect your electronic equipment from an EMP burst.</p>
<p>In this article, we will show you how to make an EMP portable machine jammer from scratch. The best part is that you don’t need any special skills or tools to do it!</p>
<ol>
<li>First, gather the supplies you will need. You will need:<br>-A metal box (small enough to fit in your pocket)<br>-A battery (9 volts or more)<br>-An amplifier circuit (you can find one online or build your own)<br>-Some wire<br>-Soldering iron<br>-Solder<br>-Some electrical tape<br>-A piece of metal (copper or aluminum work best)</li>
<li>Next, drill a hole in the metal box and mount the amplifier circuit inside. Make sure the amplifier circuit is facing out of the box so that it can broadcast the EMP signal. </li>
<li>Solder some wire to the amplifier circuit and run it out of the hole in the box. </li>
<li>Cut a piece of metal to fit over the hole in the box and use electrical tape to secure it in place. This will serve as your antenna for transmitting the EMP signal. </li>
<li>Connect the battery to the amplifier circuit and test it out!</li>

<h1 id="How-to-Convert-a-Regular-Device-into-an-EMP-Portable-Machine-Jammer"><a href="#How-to-Convert-a-Regular-Device-into-an-EMP-Portable-Machine-Jammer" class="headerlink" title="How to Convert a Regular Device into an EMP Portable Machine Jammer"></a>How to Convert a Regular Device into an EMP Portable Machine Jammer</h1><p>There are many reasons why someone might want to build an EMP Portable Machine Jammer. Perhaps they have a paranoid fear of being wiretapped and want to ensure their conversations remain private. Or maybe they work in a field where it is important to keep sensitive information confidential (like the military or law enforcement).</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, it is possible to convert a regular device into an EMP Portable Machine Jammer with just a few simple steps. The following guide will show you how to do it.</p>
<p>What You’ll Need:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Device You Want to Convert into a Jammer</li>
<li>An EMP Generator </li>
<li>Some Wires </li>
<li>Wire Cutters </li>
<li>Soldering Iron </li>
<li>Pliers </li>
<li>Tape </li>
<li>A Desired Frequency (optional)</li>
<li>A Calculator (optional)</li>
</ol>
<p>Step 1: Disable or Remove All Circuitry from the Device<br>The first step is to disable or remove all of the circuitry from the device you want to convert into a jammer. This can be done by cutting the wires or simply unscrewing them from the circuit board. Be very careful not to damage any of the components while doing this! If you’re not sure what you’re doing, it might be best to get help from someone who knows more about electronics than you do.</p>
<p>Step 2: Connect the EMP Generator to the Device<br>Once all of the circuitry has been removed, it’s time to connect the EMP Generator to the device. This can be done by using wires and soldering them onto the circuit board directly. Make sure that all of the connections are secure and won’t come loose when you’re using the jammer. If you don’t feel comfortable soldering, you can use tape instead; just make sure that there are no loose wires that could accidentally touch each other and create a short circuit.</p>
<p>  Step 3: Choose Your Frequency (optional) </p>
<p>Now that your jammer is assembled, it’s time to choose your frequency! This step is optional, but if you know which frequency you want to jam, it can be helpful to specifically tune your jammer for that wavelength. To do this, use a calculator (there are plenty of online calculators available) and enter in your desired frequency along with the electrical properties of your device (more information about this can be found online or in electronics textbooks). Once you have these numbers, enter them into your jammer and see how well it performs!</p>

        <h1 id="Valencia-Basket-become-first-Spanish-club-to-win-European-crown"><a href="#Valencia-Basket-become-first-Spanish-club-to-win-European-crown" class="headerlink" title="Valencia Basket become first Spanish club to win European crown"></a>Valencia Basket become first Spanish club to win European crown</h1><p>Valencia Basket stunned Maccabi Tel Aviv 85-77 on Sunday to become the first Spanish club to win the EuroCup and complete a fairytale rise from also-rans to European champions in just two years under coach Velimir Perasovic.</p>
<p> Valencia’s previous best performance in Europe’s second-tier competition was reaching the last eight in 2014 but they were irresistible in a one-sided final, thanks largely to American playmaker Will Thomas who top-scored with 22 points.</p>
<p>Valencia led by as many as 18 points in the third quarter but with Maccabi mounting a comeback, the match went down to the wire before the home side held their nerve to seal a famous victory.</p>
<p>“It’s amazing, I’m so happy for my players and for Valencia,” delighted Perasovic said after his side became only the second club after CSKA Moscow to claim back-to-back EuroCup titles.</p>
<p>“This is an incredibly special moment for me and for Valencia. We worked so hard for this and it’s a fantastic feeling to be European champions.”</p>
<p>With Fernando San Emeterio injured, Thomas was Valencia’s go-to man throughout the final and he more than delivered, scoring 16 points in the first half as Valencia stormed into a 47-36 lead at the break.</p>
<h1 id="Luka-Doncic-shines-in-Euroleague-final-earns-MVP-award"><a href="#Luka-Doncic-shines-in-Euroleague-final-earns-MVP-award" class="headerlink" title="Luka Doncic shines in Euroleague final, earns MVP award"></a>Luka Doncic shines in Euroleague final, earns MVP award</h1><p>Just 19 years old, Luka Doncic has capably led Real Madrid to their second consecutive Euroleague championship. In the final against Olympiacos, Doncic scored 26 points on 8-of-12 shooting while adding eight rebounds and six assists. For his efforts, he was named Euroleague MVP.</p>
<p>“It’s a great honor,” Doncic said after the game. “I’m just happy we could win this trophy.”</p>
<p>Doncic is widely considered one of the best young players in the world and is expected to be one of the top picks in next year’s NBA draft. With his MVP performance in the Euroleague final, he has only further cemented his status as one of the most promising prospects in basketball.</p>
<h1 id="Giannis-Antetokounmpo-leads-Milwaukee-Bucks-to-first-NBA-title"><a href="#Giannis-Antetokounmpo-leads-Milwaukee-Bucks-to-first-NBA-title" class="headerlink" title="Giannis Antetokounmpo leads Milwaukee Bucks to first NBA title"></a>Giannis Antetokounmpo leads Milwaukee Bucks to first NBA title</h1><p>Giannis Antetokounmpo was the key player for the Milwaukee Bucks as they won their first NBA title. He averaged 27.7 points, 12.5 rebounds, and 5.9 assists per game in the playoffs as the Bucks defeated the Toronto Raptors in six games.</p>
<p>This was a historic victory for the Bucks, who had never won an NBA championship before. Antetokounmpo was awarded MVP of the Finals, and he showed why he is one of the best players in the league.</p>
<p>The Bucks were led by their superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo throughout these playoffs but it’s important not to lose sight of some of his supporting cast. Khris Middleton played at a high level averaging 19 points and 7 rebounds per game while Brook Lopez provided some much-needed shooting coming off the bench averaging 14 points per game on 47% from three. Malcolm Brogdon also provided valuable minutes as a backup point guard averaging 6 points and 3 assists off the bench against Toronto. Although there were other contributors along the way, make no mistake; this title would not have been possible without The Greek Freak’s dominance night in and night out.</p>
<p>What makes Giannis so unique is his blend of size, speed, ball-handling, and court vision that allows him to do things that other players simply can’t do. In Game 1 of the Finals against Toronto he showed his entire arsenal completing an incredible between-the-legs dunk while also dropping 36 points on 13-of-22 shooting including 4-of-8 from three. This performance set the tone for Milwaukee who carried that momentum throughout the series en route to their first title in franchise history.</p>
<p>Looking ahead there is no doubt that Giannis will be among the favorites to win MVP next season as he looks to lead Milwaukee back to the Finals and repeat as champions. There may be some new faces on this Bucks squad next year but make no mistake; they will be led by The Greek Freak once again who has firmly established himself as one of the best players in NBA history.</p>
<h1 id="Boston-Celtics-stun-Golden-State-Warriors-in-dramatic-NBA-Finals-victory"><a href="#Boston-Celtics-stun-Golden-State-Warriors-in-dramatic-NBA-Finals-victory" class="headerlink" title="Boston Celtics stun Golden State Warriors in dramatic NBA Finals victory"></a>Boston Celtics stun Golden State Warriors in dramatic NBA Finals victory</h1><p>In one of the most stunning upsets in NBA history, the Boston Celtics have defeated the Golden State Warriors in Game Five of the NBA Finals, 108-86.</p>
<p>With their backs against the wall, trailing 3-1 in the series, many had written off the Celtics. But they proved the doubters wrong with a dominant performance in front of a home crowd at TD Garden.</p>
<p>Kyrie Irving was outstanding for Boston, leading all scorers with 26 points. Jaylen Brown and Terry Rozier also contributed heavily, scoring 20 and 18 points respectively.</p>
<p>The Warriors were led by Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry, who scored 26 and 23 points respectively. But it wasn’t enough to overcome Boston’s inspired play.</p>
<p>The Celtics will now advance to face the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Eastern Conference Finals.</p>
<h1 id="Liverpool-FC-crowned-champions-of-Europe-after-beating-Tottenham-Hotspur-in-Champions-League-final"><a href="#Liverpool-FC-crowned-champions-of-Europe-after-beating-Tottenham-Hotspur-in-Champions-League-final" class="headerlink" title="Liverpool FC crowned champions of Europe after beating Tottenham Hotspur in Champions League final."></a>Liverpool FC crowned champions of Europe after beating Tottenham Hotspur in Champions League final.</h1><p>Liverpool FC are European champions for a sixth time after they defeated Tottenham Hotspur 2-0 in Madrid. Mohamed Salah’s early penalty and Divock Origi’s late goal secured victory for Jurgen Klopp’s side, who were crowned champions of Europe for the first time since 2005.</p>
<p>Liverpool started the game brightly and took the lead in the 12th minute when Hugo Lloris brought down Salah in the penalty area. The Egyptian international stepped up to take the spot-kick and calmly converted it into the bottom left corner. Spurs created few clear-cut chances in the first half, with only Christian Eriksen testing Alisson Becker with a long-range effort.</p>
<p>Origi came on as a substitute for Liverpool in the second half and doubled their lead in the 87th minute with a well-taken finish. The Belgian forward was played through on goal by Trent Alexander-Arnold and coolly finished into the bottom corner beyond Lloris. Tottenham pushed for a goal in injury time but were unable to find a way past Alisson, who made some crucial saves to preserve Liverpool’s lead.</p>
<p>The victory means that Klopp has become only the sixth manager in history to win Champions League titles with two different clubs, after his successes with Borussia Dortmund in 2013. It was also a memorable night for veteran goalkeeper Alisson, who became just the second Brazilian player to win Europe’s top club prize.</p>
