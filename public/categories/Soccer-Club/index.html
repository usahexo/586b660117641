        <h1 id="How-many-members-are-in-the-club"><a href="#How-many-members-are-in-the-club" class="headerlink" title="How many members are in the club?"></a>How many members are in the club?</h1><p>The answer to this question is a little complicated. Depending on how you look at it, there are different answers. There are around 1000 members in the club, but this number can change depending on how you count people.</p>
<p>If you consider only dues-paying members, then there are only about 900 people in the club. However, if you include people who have attended meetings or events, then the number of people in the club swells to over 1000. This larger group includes friends of members and people who have simply been to one event.</p>
<p>So, the answer to the question depends on what criteria you use to determine membership. If you just look at the number of people who have paid dues, then the club has around 900 members. But if you include everyone who has ever attended an event or meeting, then there are over 1000 members.</p>
<h1 id="How-did-the-club-form"><a href="#How-did-the-club-form" class="headerlink" title="How did the club form?"></a>How did the club form?</h1><p>The history of how the club came to be is a long and winding one. It all started back in 1892, when a group of workers from the Victorian Railways got together to form a football team. The club was originally called Essendon Railway Football Club, and they played their first official match in 1893.</p>
<p>In 1901, the club was renamed Essendon Football Club, and they joined the VFL (Victorian Football League). They made it all the way to the Grand Final in 1932, but they unfortunately lost to South Melbourne.</p>
<p>Over the years, Essendon has had some pretty talented players join their ranks. Players like Michael Long and James Hird have helped the club achieve great success on the field.</p>
<p>The club was also impacted by the 2006 AFL doping scandal, which saw a number of players banned from playing for two years. However, they have since bounced back and are now one of the most successful clubs in the league.</p>
<h1 id="Who-are-the-current-leaders-of-the-club"><a href="#Who-are-the-current-leaders-of-the-club" class="headerlink" title="Who are the current leaders of the club?"></a>Who are the current leaders of the club?</h1><p>The current leaders of the club are president Enrique Cerezo and sporting director Fernando Hierro.</p>
<p>Enrique Cerezo took over as President in November of 2006, after former president Jesus Gil y Gil passed away. He had previously been the Vice President of the club.<br>E Cerezo is a businessman from Madrid and has been involved in many other businesses outside of football.<br>F Hierro is a former Spanish international footballer who played for Real Madrid, Liverpool, and Bolton Wanderers. After his retirement from playing, he worked as a television commentator and coach before being appointed Sporting Director in October of 2014.</p>
<h1 id="What-achievements-are-the-club-proud-of"><a href="#What-achievements-are-the-club-proud-of" class="headerlink" title="What achievements are the club proud of?"></a>What achievements are the club proud of?</h1><p>Manchester United is one of the most popular football clubs in the world.

<h1 id="What-is-the-club’s-vision-for-2022"><a href="#What-is-the-club’s-vision-for-2022" class="headerlink" title="What is the club’s vision for 2022?"></a>What is the club’s vision for 2022?</h1><p>The club’s vision for 2022 is to win the Premier League and Champions League.
