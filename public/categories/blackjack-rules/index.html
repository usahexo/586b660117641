Boasting over one thousand slot machines and dozens of gaming tables, the new casino is already a major attraction in the city.</p>
<p>Philadelphia has always been a popular destination for gambling, with its many popular casinos and horse tracks. But the new casino is something special - it’s the only casino located inside the city limits. This makes it much more convenient for Philadelphia residents, who no longer have to travel to Atlantic City or Lancaster County to enjoy some gambling fun.</p>
<p>The new casino is also home to several restaurants and bars, giving visitors plenty of options for food and drinks. There’s even a hotel on-site, so guests can stay overnight and continue enjoying the casino’s excellent offerings.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a great place to gamble in Philadelphia, the new casino is definitely worth checking out!</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Employees-Face-Possible-Layoffs"><a href="#Casino-Employees-Face-Possible-Layoffs" class="headerlink" title="Casino Employees Face Possible Layoffs"></a>Casino Employees Face Possible Layoffs</h1><p>Casino employees in the United States are facing the possibility of layoffs due to the increasing popularity of online gambling. Many brick-and-mortar casinos are struggling to keep up with the competition from online casinos, which have been able to offer their services to a wider audience at a lower cost. As a result, many casino employees are at risk of losing their jobs.</p>
<p>The first casualties of this trend have been in Atlantic City, where four of the twelve casinos have closed since 2014. Thousands of employees have lost their jobs as a result, and more layoffs are expected in the coming months. Other states that have seen a decline in casino revenue, such as Pennsylvania and Illinois, are also facing the prospect of mass layoffs.</p>
<p>Casino employees have responded to the news by organizing protests and pleading with lawmakers to do something to help them save their jobs. They argue that they are not responsible for the decline in casino revenue and that they should not be penalized for it.</p>
<p>So far, lawmakers have been unwilling to help casino employees, arguing that they should instead be focusing on helping the casinos themselves. This may be changing, as there is now talk of providing financial assistance to casinos in order to help them compete with online gambling sites. However, it is still too early to say whether or not such a plan will be implemented.</p>
<p>In the meantime, casino employees continue to live in fear of losing their jobs. Many of them are already struggling financially, and they know that they would have difficulty finding another job in today’s economy. They hope that lawmakers will eventually come up with a plan that will save their jobs, but they are not holding their breath.</p>
<h1 id="What’s-The-Name-of-The-New-Casino-Inside-Philadelphia"><a href="#What’s-The-Name-of-The-New-Casino-Inside-Philadelphia" class="headerlink" title="What’s The Name of The New Casino Inside Philadelphia?"></a>What’s The Name of The New Casino Inside Philadelphia?</h1><p>The Rushmore Casino is set to open on September 12, inside the city of Philadelphia. The $22 million project will bring much needed jobs to the area and much needed tax money to the city. But what will it be called?</p>
<p>That’s still up in the air. Owner James Marsh wants to team up with a major casino company to get the word out, and he’s considering several names, but nothing has been announced as of yet.</p>
<p>Some of the names being considered are: </p>
<ul>
<li>The Rushmore Casino</li>
<li>The Philadelphia Rushmore Casino</li>
<li>The SugarHouse Casino (proposed name of affiliated business) </li>
<li>Monumental Casino</li>
<li>Liberty Bell Casino</li>
</ul>
<p>Marsh would not reveal any more details about the forthcoming casino, except that it will be a “full service” establishment with table games, slots, and a restaurant. He also mentioned that they are currently in the process of hiring 400 employees. </p>
<p>The opening of this new casino is long overdue. For years, Philadelphia has been without a proper gambling venue, while its neighbors in New Jersey have enjoyed world-class casinos like Atlantic City and Foxwoods. With Pennsylvania legalizing gambling in 2006, it was only a matter of time before somebody stepped up to fill that void. </p>
<p>And now, finally, Rushmore Casino is doing just that. This new casino is set to make a big impact on the local economy, not just by creating jobs but also by generating sorely needed revenue for the city government.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Revenue-Down-But-Officials-Optimistic"><a href="#Casino-Revenue-Down-But-Officials-Optimistic" class="headerlink" title="Casino Revenue Down, But Officials Optimistic"></a>Casino Revenue Down, But Officials Optimistic</h1><p>Casino gaming revenue continues to decline in Nevada, with a drop of 6 percent in May 2018, compared to the same month last year. However, some officials are still optimistic about the future of the industry.</p>
<p>The downturn is partially attributed to the legalization of gambling in other states, including New Jersey and Pennsylvania. In addition, the rise of esports and other forms of gambling have taken away from casino revenue.</p>
<p>Despite this, some casinos are seeing growth in other areas, such as food and beverage sales and hotel occupancy. And with new developments coming online in Las Vegas, officials remain hopeful that gambling will rebound in the near future.</p>
<h1 id="Inside-Look-At-Philadelphia’s-New-Casino"><a href="#Inside-Look-At-Philadelphia’s-New-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Inside Look At Philadelphia’s New Casino"></a>Inside Look At Philadelphia’s New Casino</h1><p>The much anticipated opening of the SugarHouse Casino in Philadelphia finally happened this week. The $164 million facility is now the largest casino in Pennsylvania. The new casino offers 1,600 slot machines, table games, and a 24-hour poker room.</p>
<p>It was clear from the start that the new casino was going to be a huge success. On its opening day, more than 12,000 people flooded through its doors. Even more impressive is the fact that the casino has managed to generate over $1 million in revenue in just four days.</p>
<p>So what makes the SugarHouse Casino so special? For starters, it’s located right on the waterfront overlooking the Delaware River. This provides some amazing views and makes for a really unique gaming experience. The casino is also smaller and more intimate than many of the other casinos in Pennsylvania, which gives it a more relaxed atmosphere.</p>
<p>One of the main attractions at the new casino is its high-limit area. This features luxurious private gaming rooms where you can play blackjack, roulette, and baccarat with stakes as high as $25,000 per hand. There are also several private dining areas where you can enjoy a meal while you play.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for something to do in Philadelphia outside of gambling, the new casino is conveniently located close to many of the city’s top tourist attractions. It’s just a short walk from Chinatown and historic downtown Philadelphia. There’s also a tram stop right outside the casino that will take you to other popular destinations like Penn’s Landing and Independence National Historical Park.</p>
