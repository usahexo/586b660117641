#  Do you think gambling sites will have a significant impact on Burnley's economy in 2022? 

There is no definitive answer, as the long-term economic impacts of gambling sites are difficult to predict. However, some experts believe that they could have a significant positive impact on Burnley's economy.

Gambling sites can generate a great deal of revenue for a city or region. In 2017, for example, the gambling industry in Macau generated $38.5 billion in revenue – more than twice the amount generated by the Las Vegas Strip. By 2022, it is predicted that spending on gambling in the Asia-Pacific region will reach $608 billion, so there is certainly potential for Burnley's economy to benefit from this growth.

Gambling sites can also create jobs and boost tourism. In Burnley, for example, new casino resorts could create up to 2,500 jobs. And with millions of people visiting gambling destinations each year, Burnley could see an increase in tourist numbers if it establishes itself as a gambling hub.

Of course, there are some potential pitfalls to consider. Gambling can be addictive and lead to financial problems for some people. Additionally, there is always the possibility that gambling sites could negatively impact local businesses if people choose to gamble rather than spend their money elsewhere.

Ultimately, it is hard to say what sort of impact gambling sites will have on Burnley's economy in 2022. However, there is certainly potential for them to bring substantial benefits to the region.

#  Do you think Martin O'Neill will still be the manager of Burnley in 2022?

Do you think Martin O'Neill will still be the manager of Burnley in 2022?

#  What do you think Burnley's chances are of winning the Premier League in 2022? 

This is a difficult question to answer, as Burnley's chances will undoubtedly depend on a number of factors, including the team's performance in 2020-21 and the level of competition they face from other Premier League clubs.

That said, if Burnley can continue their current form and make some shrewd signings in the next year or two, there's no reason why they couldn't be crowned champions in 2022. The Clarets have been one of the most impressive teams in the Premier League this season, showing great resilience and organisation under Manager Sean Dyche.

It's also worth noting that Burnley have a very strong home record, having lost just 2 of their last 22 games at Turf Moor. This could give them an edge over their rivals in any potential playoff matches or final showdown for the title.

All things considered, Burnley definitely have what it takes to win the Premier League in 2022 - but whether they can actually achieve this is another question altogether!

3. The rise of eSports betting
