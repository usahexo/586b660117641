#  Don't Gamble Away Your Tax Refund - Know How Much You Can Claim

Once you've received your tax refund, it's tempting to gamble it all away in one go. But before you do, make sure you know how much you're allowed to claim in gambling losses.

In general, you can only deduct gambling losses if you itemize your deductions. You can claim both the amount of your winnings and your losses, but the total cannot be more than the amount of your winnings. In other words, you can't use your gambling losses to reduce your taxable income to zero.

Keep in mind that only losses from gambling activities that are considered illegal are deductible. Gambling losses from games of chance such as blackjack, craps, roulette, and slots are deductible, while losses from games of skill like poker are not.

If you file a joint return, your spouse is also allowed to claim any gambling losses incurred during the year. However, if you file separately, you can only claim your own losses.

So before you head to the casino or the racetrack with your tax refund, make sure you understand how much you're allowed to claim in gambling losses. It might not be as much as you think!

#  Gambling Losses Now allowable on Tax Returns

Gambling losses can now be claimed on your tax return. The IRS has released new guidelines stating that taxpayers can deduct gambling losses up to the amount of their winnings. This change is effective for the 2017 tax year.

To claim your gambling losses, you will need to itemize your deductions on Schedule A. You can deduct your losses in any one calendar year, but they must be reported separately from your other income. In other words, you cannot combine your gambling losses with your other income and claim them as a deduction.

For example, let’s say you had $1,000 in gambling winnings and $2,000 in gambling losses during the year. You would report $1,000 of income on line 21 of your Form 1040 and $1,000 of deductions on Schedule A (line 28).

The new rules provide some relief for taxpayers who have suffered from gambling addiction. Previously, these taxpayers were not able to claim any of their losses as a deduction. Now, they can claim up to the amount of their winnings.

#  How Much Can You Claim In Gambling Losses? 

If you're a United States taxpayer, you can claim gambling losses on your tax return. To do so, however, you must itemize your deductions and have records to document your losses. The amount of your deduction will generally be the amount of your losses less the amount of your winnings.

Gambling losses can be claimed as a miscellaneous deduction on Schedule A of Form 1040. You can deduct gambling losses only up to the amount of your gambling income. Therefore, if you have $1,000 in gambling income and $2,000 in gambling losses, you can only claim a $1,000 deduction for your losses.

In order to claim your gambling losses, you must have documentation to back them up. This includes receipts from the casinos or other establishments where you gambled, as well as documentation of any winnings (such as casino chips, tickets, or payout slips). If you don't have this documentation, the IRS may disallow your deduction.

There are other limitations on claiming gambling losses. First, the deduction is available only to taxpayers who itemize their deductions. If you take the standard deduction instead of itemizing, you cannot claim a deduction for your gambling losses. Second, the deduction is limited to those expenses that are "ordinary and necessary" in carrying out your gambling activity. This means that you can't deduct things like travel expenses to and from the casino or meals purchased while there. 

Despite these limitations, gambling losses provide a valuable tax deduction for those who qualify to take it. If you have records to support your claims, be sure to include them when preparing your tax return.

#  Keep Track Of Your Gambling Winnings and Losses 

When you gamble, you may be tempted to just “wing it” and not bother with tracking your wins and losses. After all, what’s the point? But keeping track of your gambling activity is very important, for a variety of reasons.

First, accurately tracking your wins and losses can help you stay aware of how much money you’re spending on gambling. This can be helpful in preventing you from overspending and going into debt because of your gambling habit.

Second, tracking your gambling activity can help you become a more successful gambler. By knowing which games you tend to win or lose money on, you can make smarter gambling choices and increase your chances of coming out ahead.

Finally, maintaining a record of your wins and losses can be helpful in the event that you need to file a tax return related to your gambling activities. Keeping track of your net gambling gain or loss can help reduce how much tax you owe on those earnings.

There are a number of different ways to track your gambling activity. Some people prefer to use a physical ledger book, while others use online tools or mobile apps. Whichever method you choose, make sure to stick with it so that your data is accurate and up-to-date.

If you’re not sure where to start when it comes to tracking your gambling activity, here are a few tips: 

- Start by recording the date, amount, and type of bet for each game you play.

- Make note of whether you won or lost money on each wager.

- Keep track of any chips or tokens that you win or lose. This will help ensure accuracy when calculating your total winnings or losses.

- Try to be as specific as possible when recording information about your bets. For example, if you’re playing blackjack, record the denomination of the chips that were used in each hand. This will make it easier to calculate your winnings or losses at the end of the night.

#  What's The Limit On Gambling Losses We Can Claim?

People in the United States love to gamble, and with good reason: the potential payoffs can be huge. But what happens when we lose? Are we on the hook for the entire amount?

In a word, no. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) allows taxpayers to claim gambling losses as itemized deductions on their tax returns. This can reduce your taxable income and save you money.

But there are limits to how much you can deduct. You can only claim losses up to the amount of your winnings. So if you win $1,000 but lose $1,500, you can only deduct $1,000 in losses.

You can also only deduct gambling losses if you itemize deductions on your return. If you take the standard deduction instead, you can't claim any gambling losses.

There are other restrictions too. For example, you can only deduct gambling losses if they were incurred in a "qualified gaming activity." This includes activities like betting on horses or poker games, but not casino slots or table games.

And finally, you can't use gambling losses to cancel out other types of income. So if you have $10,000 in taxable income from your job and $5,000 in gambling losses, your taxable income would still be $10,000.

So if you're a gambler, make sure to keep track of your winnings and losses so that you can claim them on your tax return. It could save you some money!
