#  Hollywood Casino in St. Louis Now Owned and Operated by She Ninja Suzu Game!

The Hollywood Casino in downtown St. Louis has a new owner and operator, and it's none other than the popular mobile game developer She Ninja Suzu! The casino, which was formerly owned and operated by Penn National Gaming, has been closed since late September for a "facelift" and is now scheduled to reopen on December 1 under the new ownership.

She Ninja Suzu is best known for their popular mobile games such as "She Ninja Suzu: Attack of the Zombie Pirates" and "Gardens of Time: Quest for the Crown". The company has also developed a number of casino-style games for mobile devices, so the acquisition of the Hollywood Casino fits well with their business strategy.

In an interview with the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, She Ninja Suzu CEO Kari Willette said that her company plans to "rebrand and relaunch" the Hollywood Casino. "We're going to make it into an entertainment destination," she said. "There will be something for everyone."

Details about the rebranding effort have not yet been released, but Willette promised that there will be plenty of new attractions at the casino, including new restaurants, bars, and entertainment venues. She also said that they plan to add more casino games to the lineup, including some that haven't been seen in Missouri before.

The Hollywood Casino is one of only two casinos in St. Louis (the other being Lumiere Place), so it's likely that She Ninja Suzu's rebranding efforts will be successful in attracting more visitors to downtown St. Louis. This could be great news for businesses in the area, as increased tourism usually leads to more jobs and economic growth.
