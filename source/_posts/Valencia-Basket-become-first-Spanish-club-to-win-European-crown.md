#  Valencia Basket become first Spanish club to win European crown

Valencia Basket stunned Maccabi Tel Aviv 85-77 on Sunday to become the first Spanish club to win the EuroCup and complete a fairytale rise from also-rans to European champions in just two years under coach Velimir Perasovic.

 Valencia's previous best performance in Europe's second-tier competition was reaching the last eight in 2014 but they were irresistible in a one-sided final, thanks largely to American playmaker Will Thomas who top-scored with 22 points.

Valencia led by as many as 18 points in the third quarter but with Maccabi mounting a comeback, the match went down to the wire before the home side held their nerve to seal a famous victory.

"It's amazing, I'm so happy for my players and for Valencia," delighted Perasovic said after his side became only the second club after CSKA Moscow to claim back-to-back EuroCup titles.

"This is an incredibly special moment for me and for Valencia. We worked so hard for this and it's a fantastic feeling to be European champions."

With Fernando San Emeterio injured, Thomas was Valencia's go-to man throughout the final and he more than delivered, scoring 16 points in the first half as Valencia stormed into a 47-36 lead at the break.

#  Luka Doncic shines in Euroleague final, earns MVP award

Just 19 years old, Luka Doncic has capably led Real Madrid to their second consecutive Euroleague championship. In the final against Olympiacos, Doncic scored 26 points on 8-of-12 shooting while adding eight rebounds and six assists. For his efforts, he was named Euroleague MVP.

"It's a great honor," Doncic said after the game. "I'm just happy we could win this trophy."

Doncic is widely considered one of the best young players in the world and is expected to be one of the top picks in next year's NBA draft. With his MVP performance in the Euroleague final, he has only further cemented his status as one of the most promising prospects in basketball.

#  Giannis Antetokounmpo leads Milwaukee Bucks to first NBA title

Giannis Antetokounmpo was the key player for the Milwaukee Bucks as they won their first NBA title. He averaged 27.7 points, 12.5 rebounds, and 5.9 assists per game in the playoffs as the Bucks defeated the Toronto Raptors in six games.

This was a historic victory for the Bucks, who had never won an NBA championship before. Antetokounmpo was awarded MVP of the Finals, and he showed why he is one of the best players in the league.

The Bucks were led by their superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo throughout these playoffs but it’s important not to lose sight of some of his supporting cast. Khris Middleton played at a high level averaging 19 points and 7 rebounds per game while Brook Lopez provided some much-needed shooting coming off the bench averaging 14 points per game on 47% from three. Malcolm Brogdon also provided valuable minutes as a backup point guard averaging 6 points and 3 assists off the bench against Toronto. Although there were other contributors along the way, make no mistake; this title would not have been possible without The Greek Freak’s dominance night in and night out.

What makes Giannis so unique is his blend of size, speed, ball-handling, and court vision that allows him to do things that other players simply can’t do. In Game 1 of the Finals against Toronto he showed his entire arsenal completing an incredible between-the-legs dunk while also dropping 36 points on 13-of-22 shooting including 4-of-8 from three. This performance set the tone for Milwaukee who carried that momentum throughout the series en route to their first title in franchise history.

Looking ahead there is no doubt that Giannis will be among the favorites to win MVP next season as he looks to lead Milwaukee back to the Finals and repeat as champions. There may be some new faces on this Bucks squad next year but make no mistake; they will be led by The Greek Freak once again who has firmly established himself as one of the best players in NBA history.

#  Boston Celtics stun Golden State Warriors in dramatic NBA Finals victory

In one of the most stunning upsets in NBA history, the Boston Celtics have defeated the Golden State Warriors in Game Five of the NBA Finals, 108-86.

With their backs against the wall, trailing 3-1 in the series, many had written off the Celtics. But they proved the doubters wrong with a dominant performance in front of a home crowd at TD Garden.

Kyrie Irving was outstanding for Boston, leading all scorers with 26 points. Jaylen Brown and Terry Rozier also contributed heavily, scoring 20 and 18 points respectively.

The Warriors were led by Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry, who scored 26 and 23 points respectively. But it wasn't enough to overcome Boston's inspired play.

The Celtics will now advance to face the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Eastern Conference Finals.

#  Liverpool FC crowned champions of Europe after beating Tottenham Hotspur in Champions League final.

Liverpool FC are European champions for a sixth time after they defeated Tottenham Hotspur 2-0 in Madrid. Mohamed Salah’s early penalty and Divock Origi’s late goal secured victory for Jurgen Klopp’s side, who were crowned champions of Europe for the first time since 2005.

Liverpool started the game brightly and took the lead in the 12th minute when Hugo Lloris brought down Salah in the penalty area. The Egyptian international stepped up to take the spot-kick and calmly converted it into the bottom left corner. Spurs created few clear-cut chances in the first half, with only Christian Eriksen testing Alisson Becker with a long-range effort.

Origi came on as a substitute for Liverpool in the second half and doubled their lead in the 87th minute with a well-taken finish. The Belgian forward was played through on goal by Trent Alexander-Arnold and coolly finished into the bottom corner beyond Lloris. Tottenham pushed for a goal in injury time but were unable to find a way past Alisson, who made some crucial saves to preserve Liverpool’s lead.

The victory means that Klopp has become only the sixth manager in history to win Champions League titles with two different clubs, after his successes with Borussia Dortmund in 2013. It was also a memorable night for veteran goalkeeper Alisson, who became just the second Brazilian player to win Europe’s top club prize.
