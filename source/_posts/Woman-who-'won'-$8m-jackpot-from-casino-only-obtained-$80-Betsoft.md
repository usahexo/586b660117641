#  Woman who 'won' $8m jackpot from casino only obtained $80 Betsoft


#  Woman who cashed in on casino's $8m jackpot only got a measly $80 Betsoft

When a woman hit an $8 million jackpot at a Betsoft casino, the last thing she expected was to only get $80 out of it. But that's exactly what happened, and now she's taking the casino to court.

The woman, who has chosen to remain anonymous, says that she was playing the slots at the casino when she hit the jackpot. She was understandably excited, and couldn't believe her luck. But when she asked the casino staff how much she'd won, they told her that she'd only scored a payout of $80.

She immediately went to speak to management, but they refused to give her anything more than her original winnings. Now she's decided to take them to court in the hopes of getting a larger payout.

Casinos are often reluctant to pay out large sums of money, especially if there's any suspicion of wrongdoing on the part of the player. But in this case, it seems clear that the woman was just lucky enough to hit a big jackpot. It's unfair that she should only receive a fraction of what she's owed.

Hopefully this case will set a precedent for other players who have similarly been shortchanged by casinos. The woman deserves to be paid what she rightly won!

The woman, who has chosen to remain anonymous, is reported to have deposited $10 into her account at the casino and played on a range of games before hitting the massive win.

In a statement, the casino said that they were “thrilled” to have paid out such a substantial sum but disappointed that the woman had only received a $80 bonus.

A Betsoft spokesperson said: "We are sorry that our player did not receive the full jackpot amount, but we are pleased that she enjoyed playing our games and winning such a large sum."

The woman is reported to have plans to use her windfall to pay off her mortgage and take an extended holiday.

#  Woman scores big at casino, takes home just $80 from Betsoft bonus

There was great news for one woman in Nevada over the weekend as she walked away from the casino with a cool $80 after triggering a Betsoft bonus.

The woman, who has not been identified, reportedly played at the Silver Oak Casino using her $100 deposit to trigger a 100% match bonus worth an additional $100. She then went on to play a selection of slots games, eventually hitting the big winnings that led to the tidy payout.

In spite of the relatively small amount won, the woman will no doubt be celebrating her good fortune. It's always nice to get something back from a casino bonus, especially as they are typically seen as being more advantageous to the casino rather than the player.

It's not clear what games the woman played to achieve her win, but we can likely expect some exciting new titles from Betsoft in the near future. The company is well-known for creating high-quality slots games with cinematic graphics and engaging gameplay features. If you're looking for some top quality action, Betsoft is always a good place to start.

There are plenty of other great casinos out there too though, so it's important to do your research before settling on one. Make sure you take into account things like game selection, bonuses and customer support when making your choice.

# Casino execs scratching their heads after woman wins $8m jackpot but walks away with just $80 from Betsoft

The winners of big jackpots at online casinos are often paid in instalments over a period of time, to ensure they don't lose too much of their windfall all at once.

But when a woman hit an $8 million jackpot on a Betsoft slot machine last week and walked away with just $80, casino executives were left scratching their heads.

The unidentified winner played the "Sugar Pop" game for around two hours before landing the massive prize, but according to local media reports she only collected a total of $80 from the casino.

A Betsoft spokesperson said the woman was paid in full and there was no issue with the win. But with such a large sum of money at stake, many observers are still puzzled by what happened.

It's not clear if the woman simply didn't realise she'd won so much money or if there was some problem with the payout process. But regardless of the reason, it's safe to say casino executives are disappointed they didn't get to keep a bigger slice of that massive jackpot.
