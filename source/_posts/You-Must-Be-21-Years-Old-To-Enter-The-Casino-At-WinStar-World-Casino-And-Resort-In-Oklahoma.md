#  You Have To Be 21 Years Old To Gamble In Oklahoma

If you want to gamble in the state of Oklahoma, you have to be 21 years old. That's the law in the Sooner State.

The minimum age to gamble in Oklahoma is set by the state legislature. The law, which was last updated in 2006, states that "No person shall gambling at any game, sport, or amusement whatever, or bet on the result of any race or game."

In order to enforce this law, the Oklahoma Alcoholic Beverage Laws Enforcement (ABLE) Commission has a special unit that monitors casinos and other gambling establishments. ABLE agents make sure that those who are gambling are of legal age.

While there are no casinos in Oklahoma City proper, there are several Native American casinos located throughout the state. Tulsa is home to the largest casino in Oklahoma - The Cherokee Casino & Resort.

There are also numerous bingo halls and racetracks throughout the state that offer various forms of gambling. If you're looking to place a bet in Oklahoma, it's best to check out one of these locations.

#  Oklahoma Casinos Adopting 21+ Age Limit

In an effort to prevent underage gambling, Oklahoma casinos are adopting a 21+ age limit. The move comes as a response to a new state law that prohibits casino operators from allowing anyone under the age of 21 on the premises.

The new legislation went into effect at the beginning of August and requires all casino employees to check ID’s before permitting anyone onto the gaming floor. The law also bans those under 21 from playing electronic games or entering restaurants and bars in the casino.

According to Paul Dorrell, general manager of the Rivers Casino in Tulsa, about 90% of the casino’s customers are over 21. He said that the change will have minimal impact on business and is primarily aimed at protecting minors.

Other casino operators in the state have voiced similar sentiments, with many saying that they already had policies in place barring those under 21 from entering their establishments.

Earlier this year, the Oklahoma Indian Gaming Association released a study that showed that 78% of tribal casino patrons were over 21. The study also found that 68% of those surveyed had visited a tribal casino in the previous six months.

Casino legal experts say that while most states allow those 18 and over to gamble in land-based casinos, there is a growing trend towards implementing stricter age limits. In recent years, states such as Connecticut, Louisiana, Michigan, and New Jersey have all raised their minimum gambling age to 21.
